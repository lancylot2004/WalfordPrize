# WalfordPrize

This repository houses the files for my supporting files, for the 2022 Walford Prize, in Charterhouse School.

`bacf.py` is a quick and dirty implementation of bitstream autocorrelation. `fft.py` is a `scipy` based version of fast fourier transform, and `ac.py` is good old-fashioned autocorrelation, making use of the `librosa` library.

The three `.wav` files are exactly as they are titled, and are used as tests.
